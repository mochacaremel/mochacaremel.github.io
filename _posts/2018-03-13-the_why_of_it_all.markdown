I decided to learn software development, because I was feeling imposter syndrome pretty badly in my role in IT and felt I wanted to master something. Like truly start from the ground up and learn something so completely that my confidence would never be shaken. I wanted to own it and be more than sufficient in my knowledge, skills, and ability. 

Also, I wanted to bet on my future and take a risk. I wanted adventure. 

I've watched movies like "The Social Network" and "Steve Jobs" and those innovators really inspired me to grab life by the horns and truly live it. I wanted to step out on a limb that I wasn't sure would hold me and see if I could hang on. I wanted to live life authentically and not just coast by with a comfortable federal government job that didn't ignite my passion for constant learning. 

I want to challenge myself and see if I can create an app, join a start-up, or work for a non-profit who really could use my help. The only way I could work for a commercial enterprise is if the culture is progressive and welcomes diversity. I need to make a difference and need to be a part of something that changes the world for the better. 

Software development is the vehicle that will take me there.
