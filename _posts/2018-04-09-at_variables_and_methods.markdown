I like to think of programming terms in analogies, because it's easier to remember that way. 

A variable is like an index card. You can write anything on it. It can have any value on it. They can be of any size, large or small.

An array is like a box of staples. The box may have 0 to quite a few staples in it and you can add to or take away from the box.

A class is like a digital tablet. It can perform actions and has interfaces that you interact with to get it to perform those actions.

A method is like a sheet of music. It tells you what it needs (musical notes) and what it produces (a remix or Chopin).

An index card can refer to a sheet of music.
